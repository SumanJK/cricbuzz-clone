## End Notes

We cloned this website in in just 5 days. While origional website has many functionalities, we could manage to implement some. It's not the complete website as we have made this only from front-end. In future we are looking forward to make api requests and get real datas in real time.








## Some Important Notes

To make the payment check pass you need to enter any 12 digit no. in the card section.


## Limitations

The website does not provide real datas as we have made this only after learning html javascript and css. All the page are not responsive.
